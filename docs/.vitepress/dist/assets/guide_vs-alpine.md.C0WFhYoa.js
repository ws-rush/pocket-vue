This means:</p><ul><li>The syntax and behavior align with standard Vue.</li><li>The reactivity system is powered by <code>@vue/reactivity</code>.</li><li>It provides a smooth upgrade path. If your project&#39;s interactivity needs grow, you can transition to standard Vue with less friction.</li></ul><p>Alpine.js, while inspired by Vue, is not bound by its design decisions. It has its own unique syntax and features and may diverge further from Vue in the future. This gives it the freedom to evolve independently, but it also means there&#39;s less of a direct migration path to a full-featured framework like Vue.</p><h3 id="_3-feature-set" tabindex="-1">3.
