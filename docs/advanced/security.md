# Security

## Built-in Expression Validation

pocket-vue includes built-in expression validation that blocks potentially dangerous patterns in template expressions. The following patterns are rejected:

- **Code execution**: `eval`, `Function`, `setTimeout`, `setInterval`
- **Network access**: `XMLHttpRequest`, `fetch`, `WebSocket`, `Worker`
- **Global objects**: `window`, `document`, `globalThis`, `global`, `process`, `require`, `import`, `export`
- **Dangerous operators**: `delete`, `void`, `typeof`, `instanceof` (when used with function calls)
- **Expression length**: Expressions longer than 1000 characters are rejected

In development mode, rejected expressions will produce a console warning:

```
Potentially unsafe expression rejected: "document.cookie"
```

This provides a baseline level of protection, but it is **not a substitute for proper input sanitization**.

## XSS Vulnerabilities

pocket-vue evaluates JavaScript expressions in the templates. This means **if** pocket-vue is mounted on a region of the DOM that contains non-sanitized HTML from user data, it may lead to XSS attacks.

**If your page renders user-submitted HTML, you should prefer initializing pocket-vue using [explicit mount target](/essentials/v-scope#explicit-mount-target) so that it only processes parts that are controlled by you**.

You can also sanitize any user-submitted HTML for the `v-scope` attribute.

## Content Security Policy (CSP)

pocket-vue evaluates expressions using `new Function()`, which may be prohibited in strict CSP settings.

There is no plan to provide a CSP build because it involves shipping an expression parser which defeats the purpose of being lightweight. If you have strict CSP requirements, you should probably use standard Vue and pre-compile the templates.
