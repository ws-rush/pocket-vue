# Lifecycle Events

pocket-vue provides special lifecycle events that you can listen to on any element.

## Available Events

- `@vue:mounted`: Fired when the element is mounted and directives are initialized.
- `@vue:unmounted`: Fired when the element is unmounted (e.g., via `v-if`).

## Usage

```html
<div
  v-if="show"
  @vue:mounted="console.log('mounted on: ', $el)"
  @vue:unmounted="console.log('unmounted: ', $el)"
>
  I am visible
</div>
```

## Practical Use Cases

### Auto-focus Input

```html
<input @vue:mounted="$el.focus()">
```

### Integrating 3rd Party Libraries

You can use `@vue:mounted` to initialize jQuery plugins or other libraries on the element.

```html
<div @vue:mounted="new Pikaday({ field: $el })">
  <input type="text">
</div>
```

### Cleanup

Use `@vue:unmounted` to clean up event listeners or timers to prevent memory leaks.

## Lifecycle Diagram

Here is a visualization of the component lifecycle:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[v-scope detected] --> B{Component Init}
    B --> C[Created]
    C --> D[Mounted]
    D --> E{State Change}
    E --> F[Updated]
    F --> D
    D --> G[Element Removed]
    G --> H[Unmounted]
```

> [!NOTE]
> `v-effect` watchers are automatically disposed of when the component is unmounted.
